My dear Russell

I shall be afraid to meet you when 
you have read my views about Cavalry. I 
fear you will think me an awful heretic. But 
change in arms must bring about new 
conditions to correspond, and I think the 
man must get off his horse to fight.
I should love to come down to see you 
all but I have hardly been at home atall
since my return from Africa, and so I 
must for a month or two remain here and 
gather up the threads of my life. Otherwise I 
should have been much delighted to come to 
you.

With all kind remembrances
Yours very truly

A Conan Doyle .
