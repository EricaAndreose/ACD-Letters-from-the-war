Letter 3: Letter about Bimbashi Joyce (1897-1900)

I write you because I might not catch Burmand. Perhaps "The Coming of the Bimbashi" would be a better title. I used 'Debut' because I don't know an equivalent but certainly it should have an accent. The omission was ignorance & carelessness not design.
Best wishes for the new member.
