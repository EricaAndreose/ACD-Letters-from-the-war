Letter about The Great Boer War

My dear Sir,

I shall be back on Sunday but I go on to Edinburgh straight. Shall let you have address there. Reform Club finds me Sunday.

I don't see what we can do about bringing out the book yet, though Mr Smith is keen upon it.

We know it cannot exceed the length you mentioned. Could we not have covers all ready and everything prepared to shorten the delay when once it is finished.

Mr Smith points out that 9 pounders should be 12 pounders on page 376. Could you change that for me.

Yours very truly,
A C DOYLE.
