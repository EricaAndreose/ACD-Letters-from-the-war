My dear Smith

Watt tells me there are several eager buyers from America for the serial rights of "The Hound". I daresay you could recoup yourself for most of your outlay if you choose to resell. I will refer him to you.
I presume that I am not rigidly tied to 50,000 words in the serial, and that if the development of the story should require a few thousand more I am not debarred from charging for them. I could only give an approximate length until I came to write it, and I might possibly run to a few more than I thought at first.
I send with this the 4th and 5th instalments, the latter consisting of one long chapter. I write under some difficulty through not having any of the proofs, so I cannot refer back. I want a copy of the proofs of No 1 in its primal form, and I want Nos 2, 3, 4 and 5 in any form.
Just send me a card to say that you have had these.

With all kind regards
Yours very truly
A Conan Doyle
