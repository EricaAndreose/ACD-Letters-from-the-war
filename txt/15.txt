Dear Sir

Very many thanks for your kind letter. Since I wrote in The Times I have received much help from the Germans in England which I shall acknowledge when I write again.

I should be delighted to answer any question of Professor Herrlich, but I don't know what I can add much to what I have said in the book. I was glad to see about the Eloff correction.

With all thanks to your two friends and yourself.

Yours very truly
