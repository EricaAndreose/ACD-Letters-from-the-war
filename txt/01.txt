Letter 1 : Grant Richard

TELEGRAMS-
GRAYSNOTT. 
 
UNDERSHAW,
 
HINDHEAD,
 
HASLEMERE. 
 
My dear Grant Richards,
        	The only valid reason I can ever give a 
publisher for quitting him is that I can get better terms. So 
if I come _ with “A Duet” my terms must be high, 
But they would be great in a convenient form…as thus.
1. 	No advance.
2. 	Half yearly accounts.
3. 	Two _ per copy on _ book.
4. 	You guarantee to fairly spend €100 in
 advertising.
5. 	The form to be such as I Approve.
 
How does this strike you? If too high on too anything
 then let me know at once.
                    	I propose to sacrifice the serial rights of this book and bring it out at once in book form. This will in itself be on interesting experience & should, I believe, help the sale of the book materially. To bring it out  at a low price would be a second experiment and I think it would be well to try one experiment at a time. Therefore let it be 6 /-
        	The book will be from 60 to 70000 words. Over 50000 are done so it should be ready for appearance early in March. I shall have what I have done typed without delay.
                    	This is only the English rights of course.
                  	I am on very friendly terms with Smith and must return to him, so don’t be hurt when I do so with my next book. The fact is that this book ought to be published by a young married couple and so I give you the refusal if it.
                    	I shall be in town on Wednesday morning if you wanted to see me on any point- but I shall be rather rushed.
 
                    	With Kind regards
 
                                	Yours very truly
 
                                            	A Canon Doyle
