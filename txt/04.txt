Letter 4: Letter to G. B. Burgin (ca. 1900)

Dear Burgin,
 
I shall be here for Xmas. I am rather tied by the interest which I take in the Corps of Riflemen — a real commando of burghers — which I am forming here. I already have 60 and hope to get 100. I hope it will be part of a great movement. You could not do better than come down some shooting day, say next Saturday, spend a day here, and write the movement up in the Express. If its is known about, it will find imitators which is what I want.
 
If you could make a paragraph to the effect that my relationship to Hornung had always prevented me from expressing in public the very high opinion which I have of the quality of his works, but that I had said in conversation (as I did to you) that I regarded "Peccavi" as a very fine and a very noble book, you would be doing us both a service.
 
I'll let you know any literary news which occur to me. With your inside knowledge your literary column should be the best in London.
 
Yours very truly
 
A. C. D.
