27 Rue des Batignolles
till Saturday evening
My dear Sir,
I shall be back on Sunday but I go 
on to Edinburgh straight. Shall let-you have
address there. Reform Club finds me Sunday.
I don’t see what we can do about
bringing out the book yet, through though Mr Smith is
 keen upon it.
We know it cannot exceed the length 
you mentioned. Could we not have covers all 
ready and everything prepared to shorten the 
delay when once it is finished.

Mr Smith points out that 9 pounders 
should be 12 pounders on page 376. Could 
you change that for me.

Yours very truly
A C Doyle.


This letter was written by Arthur Conan Doyle before the publication of his book The Great Boer War first published on 23 october 1900 by Smith, Elder & Co..
The reference to "9 pounders should be 12 pounders on page 376", is from page 375 in a corresponding reference to Percy Scott's famous naval guns: "Besides these there were no fewer than sixteen naval guns from H.M.S. 'Terrible' – fourteen of which were 12-pounders, and the other two of the 4.7 type which had done such good service both at Ladysmith and with Methuen".
